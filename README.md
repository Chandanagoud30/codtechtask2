OVERVIEW OF PROJECT PROJECT:"Basic Python Calculator: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division"

OBJECTIVE

The objective of the program is to create a basic calculator in Python that allows users to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers entered by the user.

The key activities of the Python calculator program include:

Input Handling: Prompting the user to enter two numbers and select an operation.
Operation Execution: Performing the selected arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Error Handling: Managing potential errors such as invalid input or division by zero.
Output: Displaying the result of the operation to the user.

The technologies used in the Python calculator program include:

Python Programming Language: Used for developing the entire application.
Standard Input and Output: Utilized for user input and displaying results.
Functions: Defined to encapsulate the logic for each arithmetic operation.
Exception Handling: Employed to manage errors, such as invalid input or division by zero.
