The key activities of the Python calculator program include:

Input Handling: Prompting the user to enter two numbers and select an operation.
Operation Execution: Performing the selected arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Error Handling: Managing potential errors such as invalid input or division by zero.
Output: Displaying the result of the operation to the user.

The technologies used in the Python calculator program include:

Python Programming Language: Used for developing the entire application.
Standard Input and Output: Utilized for user input and displaying results.
Functions: Defined to encapsulate the logic for each arithmetic operation.
Exception Handling: Employed to manage errors, such as invalid input or division by zero.
